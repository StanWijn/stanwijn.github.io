To illustrate the model, we studied 13 common elective surgical procedures from 4 different specialties, i.e. general surgery, urology, orthopaedics and otorhinolaryngology. 
The highest gain in QALYs before and after surgery was found for total hip replacement (0.27 QALY); the lowest for arthroscopic meniscectomy (0.05 QALY). 
Most cost due to the cancellation of the procedure were made for bariatric surgery (31 Euro/pp per week); the lowest for arthroscopic meniscectomy (-2 Euro/pp per week).
