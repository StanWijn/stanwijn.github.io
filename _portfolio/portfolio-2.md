Play the HTA game at: [http://htagame.dx.am/] 

You, as a researcher in the field of health technology assessment (HTA), decide which of the three innovations has the most added value for Dutch society. The three innovations are: a new diagnostic test for prostate cancer, a new localized treatment of prostate cancer and a new robot-assisted surgery technique for prostate cancer. Your budget is limited, namely € 400,000, which you can spend on different types of research. Using this research, it can become clear which innovation has the most added value for Dutch society, if you decide correctly! Pick an innovation, you can always pick another when the results of a study are not as positive as you hoped.

Please play this game with a partner and discuss the different options and outcomes.

Summary:
-Choose your innovation out of 3 innovations
-You can always swap between innovations!
-Available budget: €400.000 per team
-Three types of research
-Goal: to gain the most health (=impact on healthcare)

Good luck!

This game was developed by the Radboudumc (Nijmegen, the Netherlands) to provide more insight in the research choices prior to release of an innovation. Limiting the budget for research provides the participant with an option: Do I want to spend more money on research or are the current results sufficient to be sure that your innovation will give the most value for money.

Original concept by Dr. Janneke Grutters & Prof. Maroeska Rovers; Evidence based surgery, Nijmegen, The Netherlands
Game build by Drs. Stan Wijn; Evidence based surgery, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
