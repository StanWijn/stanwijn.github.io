A DES model developed for educational purposes to demonstrate the possibilities of a DES model, using the surgery theater of the Radboudumc as an example. By changing the parameter of the model it becomes clear how much staff needs to be present to run one day of surgery. In the case of limited personnel, surgeries will get cancelled.

!This is only for educational purposes!
